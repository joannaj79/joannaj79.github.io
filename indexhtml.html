  <h1>Queen</h1>
  <h2>Freddi2</h2>
  <p>Empty spaces - what are we living for? 
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score? 
On and on...
Does anybody know what we are looking for?

Another hero, another mindless crime 
Behind the curtain in the pantomime 
Hold the line! 
Does anybody want to take it anymore 
</p>

<p>Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.
Another heartache, another failed romance.
On and on
Does anybody know what we are living for? 

I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now.
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free</p>
<p>koty na p³oty</p>
